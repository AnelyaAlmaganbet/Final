Documentation: Comprehensive Overview of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game project, which offers two modes of play: "Player vs Player" and "Player vs Computer." The game integrates essential features like a responsive timer, a confetti celebration for victories, and a dynamic scoreboard.
1. Project Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed for two users or one user playing against a computer. It’s implemented using modern web technologies:
•	HTML: Structures the visual layout of the game.
•	CSS: Enhances the aesthetic appeal with animations, gradients, and interactivity.
•	JavaScript: Handles the logic for gameplay, scoring, and game mechanics.
This project aims to provide an engaging and visually pleasing gaming experience.
2. Game Features
Game Modes
•	Player vs Player:
	Two players alternate turns to fill the board with their respective symbols (X or O). The 	game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
•	Player vs Computer:
	A player competes against a simple computer opponent. The computer’s moves are 	randomized but always adhere to the game rules.
Scoring and Wins
•	Each player's wins are tracked via a persistent scoreboard that updates in real-time.
•	Scores remain consistent until reset manually by the user.
Timer System
•	Each player has 15 seconds to make a move.
•	If the timer runs out, the current turn is forfeited, and the opposing player scores a win for that round.
Visual Effects and Celebration
•	Winning triggers a confetti animation alongside a celebratory message.
•	Draws and forfeits are also accompanied by appropriate text feedback.
Reset Functions
•	Reset Game: Clears the board and starts a new round while retaining the current scores.
•	Reset Scores: Resets both Player X's and Player O's scores to zero.
3. Visual and Interactive Design
Theme
•	The game uses a pink gradient theme, giving it a cheerful and modern aesthetic.
•	A blend of colors, shadows, and smooth transitions makes the interface visually appealing.
Responsive Layout
•	The design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
•	Elements like buttons and the board are evenly spaced and clickable for a seamless experience.
Animations
•	Buttons enlarge and change color upon hovering.
•	Cells are highlighted when clicked, offering real-time visual feedback.
•	The confetti effect adds excitement and engagement during wins.
4. Core Functionalities
Board Initialization
•	The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid initialized with empty cells.
•	Each cell dynamically updates when clicked, displaying the current player’s symbol.
Turn Management
•	The game alternates turns between players (or the player and the computer).
•	The active player’s moves are validated to ensure no overwriting of previously selected cells.
Victory Conditions
•	The game checks predefined winning combinations after every move:
	Rows, columns, and diagonals are verified for matching symbols.
•	If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
AI for "Player vs Computer" Mode
•	The computer selects a random empty cell for its move.
•	While basic, this logic ensures compliance with the rules and provides a competitive element.
5. Detailed Functional Components
Timer
•	The timer counts down from 15 seconds for each player’s turn.
•	If the timer reaches zero:
		The player forfeits the round.
		The opponent scores a win.
•	The timer resets after every valid move or when the game is restarted.
Scoreboard
•	Scores are tracked for both players:
		Player X: Represents one user.
		Player O: Represents the second user or the computer in "Player vs Computer" 			mode.
•	The scoreboard updates automatically after every win.
Confetti Celebration
•	A dynamic confetti effect is displayed for 5 seconds when a player wins.
•	Confetti pieces are styled randomly in terms of color, size, and animation duration, ensuring a vibrant celebration.
